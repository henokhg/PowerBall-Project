How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
• The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results.
•The Powerball game includes two parts.
     o Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white 
     ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 
     inclusively-(1,2,3, 4, 5,... , 17,18,19, 20).oPart two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers(1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
•When your program/pags runor reloaded/refreshed, itwould displaytoday’s Powerball winning numbers, yourlucky numbers, and display the resultbased on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
